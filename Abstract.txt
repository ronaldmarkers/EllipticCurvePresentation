Elliptic curves are crucial in mathematics regarding useful results and conjectures in analysis, algebraic number theory, and cryptography. To understand the importance of elliptic curves, an outline of several important concepts in number theory, such as groups and probing lines, will be defined to illustrate a crucial operation with elliptic curves, known as elliptic curve addition. Additionally, the purpose of elliptic curve addition will be stated because their countably infinite rational solutions allow for the operation to be useful and is unique to the third degree of this non-singular polynomial.
